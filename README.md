# SpeakerLocGen
Python script that creates datasets of a speaker moving in a room. The objective is to track the speaker by learning the room mapping - how the input signal is mapped to the location of the speaker.

The speech is taken from randomly selected sentences of WSJ0, recorded by a ULA microphone array. The speaker moves in an arc around the array.

The simulation accounts for several scenarios, each with different acoustic conditions (room dimensions, reverberation). The simulated speech is obtained by convolving room impulse responses (RIRs) generated by the gpuRIR package [gpuRIR] (https://github.com/DavidDiazGuerra/gpuRIR)  package with clean speech signals randomly taken from the WSJ0 dataset [WSJ0] (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S6A)


## Prerequisites
#### WSJ0
You must have the clean files of WJS0 to run the code.

#### Python
This code was designed with Python 3, so backward compatibility with Python 2 cannot be guaranteed. Note that the provided code should be run on a GPU. The following packages are required for running the code:
1. gpuRIR package
2. soundfile

gpuRIR package
soundfile

#### Docker
Docker image will be uploded soon
